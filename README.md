## Replace Vanilla Option
This option changes the graphics of the existing scarecrows, including rarecrows. You can choose whether you want dogcrows or catcrows in place of the vanilla scarecrows.

## Separate Dogcrows and Catcrows Option
This option keeps the vanilla scarecrows and introduces dogcrows and catcrows as separate craftables that you can obtain recipes of! You can unlock the basic dogcrow and catcrow at Farming Level 1, and craft it with a custom treat and other ingredients.

### Treats!
With the separate option, new treat items are introduced as the base ingredient of dogcrows and catcrows! They are sold at Marnie's Ranch, along with their respective recipes that you can cook in the kitchen.
